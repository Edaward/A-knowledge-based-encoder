# A_knowledge-based_encoder

### Intro
* This encoder is adopted from the paper: Sentence-State LSTM for Text Representation.
* slstm.py is the original code file.
* slstm_sw.py is the encoder I created.
* slstm_sw_v1.py is another version. You can try both and compare the performance.
* get_position_table.py is the file to convert the batch of sentences to the corresponding position.

### Requirements
The code was running under python 2.7, pytorch 0.4.0
